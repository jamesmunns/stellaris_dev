/**
 * MSP430 library for interacting with ShiftBrite RGB LED modules:
 * http://docs.macetech.com/doku.php/shiftbrite
 *
 * Supports a standalone single ShiftBrite, as well as chains of
 * multiple ShiftBrites.
 *
 * Wiring:
 *
 *   The ShiftBrite module works best when it powered by a 5.5-9V DC
 *   power supply. So typically you'll want to use a different power
 *   source to that powering the MSP430. Ensure the ground of the
 *   ShiftBrite supply and MSP430 supply are connected.
 *
 *   Connecting the ShiftBrite(s) requires 4 free pins on Port 1 of
 *   the MSP430 (Data, Clock, Latch and Enable). The ShiftBrite
 *   contains 'In' and 'Out' versions of these. The MSP430 should
 *   be connected to the 'In' side of the ShiftBrite.
 *
 *   Multiple ShiftBrites can be chained together by connecting the
 *   'Out' pins to the 'In' pins of the next module in the chain.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   1. Allocate a global 'shiftbrite' struct.
 *
 *     shiftbrite sb;
 *
 *   2. At startup, call 'shiftbrite_init()' function, passing in
 *   which pins the first  module in the chain is connected to.
 *
 *     shiftbrite_init(&sb,
 *                     BIT4,  // Data pin   : 1.4
 *                     BIT5,  // Latch pin  : 1.5
 *                     BIT6,  // Enable pin : 1.6
 *                     BIT7); // Clock pin  : 1.7
 *
 *   3. Enable the ShiftBrite:
 *
 *     shiftbrite_enable(&sb);
 *
 *   4. For each module in the chain, call 'shiftbrite_rgb()', to
 *   load the data into the module. Each call will shift all the
 *   values to the next module in the chain (a FIFO queue), so you
 *   need to load the values of the furthest module first.
 *
 *   If there's only one module, you need only call this once.
 *
 *   The RGB values should be in range 0-1023.
 *
 *     // Assuming there are 3 modules in the chain
 *     shiftbrite_rgb(&sb, 1023, 0, 0); // Set furthest to RED
 *     shiftbrite_rgb(&sb, 0, 1023, 0); // Set middle to GREEN
 *     shiftbrite_rgb(&sb, 0, 0, 1023); // Set closest to BLUE
 *
 *   5. 'Latch' the data. This sends a signal to each ShiftBrite
 *   that the data has been fully loaded and they should update
 *   the LEDs to the new values.
 *
 *     shiftbrite_latch(&sb);
 *
 *   6. Yay! Light!
 *
 * Other things you should know:
 *
 *   * The ShiftBrite modules can have the overall light levels
 *     configured (Dot Correction) as well as the PWM clock speed.
 *     See shiftbrite_configure()
 *
 *   * The ShiftBrite modules can be enabled/disabled quickly
 *     (i.e. turned on/off without having to reload the buffers).
 *     See shiftbrite_enable() / shiftbrite_disable()
